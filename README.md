# Fake UI Project

## Overview
This project is a Python-based application that converts HTML input into JSX using a custom `JSXConverter`. It is designed to process and transform HTML structures into JSX components for use in React or similar frameworks.

## Project Structure
- `components.py`: Contains the definitions for `Component`, `Variant`, and `ComponentAdapter`.
- `converter.py`: Implements the `JSXConverter` class, which handles the conversion of HTML to JSX.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the application. It initializes the `JSXConverter` and processes the provided HTML input.
- `registry.py`: Manages the `COMPONENTS` registry used by the `JSXConverter`.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if a `requirements.txt` file is provided).

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` script to convert the predefined HTML input into JSX.
2. Modify the `html_input` variable in `main.py` to process custom HTML content.

## Example
The `main.py` script includes an example HTML input. When executed, it will output the JSX equivalent of the HTML structure.

## Development
### Adding Components
To add new components:
1. Define the component in `components.py`.
2. Register the component in `registry.py`.

### Testing
Ensure that all components and conversions are tested thoroughly. Add test cases as needed.
